### Weary Traveler Flight Tracker

[Deployed app on Heroku](https://weary-traveler.herokuapp.com/flights)

**Lab Instructions:**
This 3 part lab was assigned during my General Assembly software immersion. This lab is commonly referred to as the "mongoose flights lab."

Part 1:
Create a scehma for the flights and implement the following user stories: Display a list of all flights on the index view, add an entry form to allow entering new flights, and create a navbar on the index view.

Part 2:
Create a destination schema and implement the following user stories: Include a link to a page that displays flight deatils, include a form that allows a user to add destination information for their flight, display the destinations on the detail page.

Part 3:
Create a tickets schema with a many to many relationship with the flights model, modify the details view to include an add ticket form, and edit the details views to show any tickets a user has entered.

**Lessons Learned:**

Being my first real experience with Mongoose and Express, this was definitely a challenge. Figuring out the proper routing was difficult, and caused a lot of confusion and frustation. With patience, I was able to properly route the entire lab, and add in the tickets and destinations rendering.

This was one of the first labs I really sought help from other students. As this was only module 2 in the bootcamp, a lot of us still didn't really know each other. It was good to seek out debugging assistance from other members of the cohort and to help them with things as well.

I spent a lot of time trying to make this lab look the way I wanted, without using a CSS framework or other assistance. There are a lot of things I need to do to this lab to make it ADA accessible for web and also improve upon the front end display. I hope to also go back and work on some of the bonus items for the lab, such as adding full delete features.

To deploy this app to Heroku, I had to incorporate MongoDB to store data.
